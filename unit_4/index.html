			<h3>Directed/written/composed<br>by Leyna Marika P.</h3>
			<p>SONG is poem, a pocket of time, a wish, a lie, a piece of you, a fragment of me, or a way to become we. SONG is a movement-based opera inspired by traditional Japanese theater performed to connect to the dead and departed.  Taking place in a mysteriously mechanical space ruled by timelessness and music, a game unfolds guiding the performers in creating fragmented self-portraits as they express the difficulties around social life, the sense of self, and a longing to escape it all. SONG illuminates the thread between life, death, and music in a musically interactive landscape with seven distinct performers.</p> 
			<!-- <p>SONG features Kamala Sankram, Ava Mendoza, Megan Stern, Chikako Bando, Christian Dautreseme, Kaoru Watanabe, and Leyna Marika P., with visual design/set by Jerry Smith, Jr., lighting design by Ayumu Poe Saegusa, costumes by Irina Arnaut, and contributing texts by Laily Longsoldier.</p> -->
